    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This pistachio layer cake with cream cheese buttercream is really special.<br> The layers are light, moist, and
        not
        too
        sweet, with plenty of pistachio flavor. <br>The presentation with the swirled top and pistachio-coated sides
        make it
        a real
        showpiece.<br> Layers can be made, wrapped well, and frozen up to a month in advance.</p>

            with a round piece of parchment paper, and spray with cooking spray.</li>

            1/2
            cups ground
            pistachios to a bowl with flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda; whisk until well combined and set
            aside.<br> Place
            remaining ground pistachios, about 1 1/3 cups, in a bowl and reserve for finishing the cake.</li>
        <br>

            down the sides as needed, until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.<br> Add egg whites and beat on high speed
            until combined,
            about 2 minutes.

            low speed until completely incorporated, about 2 minutes.<br> Mix in milk and food coloring until just
